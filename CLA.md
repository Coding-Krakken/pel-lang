# PEL Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Version 1.0, Effective February 13, 2026

Thank you for your interest in contributing to PEL (Programmable Economic Language), 
a project maintained by PEL Project Contributors and represented by David Travers 
("we", "us", or "the Project").

This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by 
contributors to the Project. This is a legally binding document, so please read it 
carefully before agreeing to it.

## Purpose

This Agreement clarifies the intellectual property rights in contributions to PEL. 
It allows us to:
- Accept your contributions
- Maintain PEL under dual licensing (AGPL-3.0 and Commercial License)
- Protect you, the Project, and users of PEL

## Agreement

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and 
future Contributions submitted to the Project. Except for the license granted 
herein to the Project and recipients of software distributed by the Project, You 
reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

### 1. Definitions

**"You"** (or **"Your"**) means the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by 
the copyright owner that is entering into this Agreement with the Project.

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any 
modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by 
You to the Project for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned 
or managed by the Project (the "Work"). "Submitted" means any form of electronic, 
verbal, or written communication sent to the Project or its representatives, 
including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code 
control systems, and issue tracking systems.

**"Copyright"** means all rights protecting works of authorship owned or controlled 
by You, including copyright, moral and neighboring rights, as appropriate, for the 
full term of their existence including any extensions by You.

**"Material"** means the work of authorship which is made available by the Project 
to third parties. When this Agreement covers more than one software project, the 
Material means the work of authorship to which the Contribution was submitted.

**"Submit"** means any form of physical, electronic, or written communication sent 
to the Project, including but not limited to electronic mailing lists, source code 
control systems, pull requests, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or 
on behalf of, the Project for the purpose of discussing and improving the Material.

### 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the 
Project and to recipients of software distributed by the Project a perpetual, 
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to:

a) Reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and 
   distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works under any license, 
   including the AGPL-3.0 or later;

b) **Sublicense and distribute Your Contributions and derivative works under 
   alternative licenses, including proprietary commercial licenses, without any 
   requirement to disclose source code or to license derivative works under 
   AGPL-3.0.** This specifically allows the Project to offer dual licensing 
   (AGPL-3.0 for open source use and Commercial License for proprietary use).

### 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the 
Project and to recipients of software distributed by the Project a perpetual, 
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in 
this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, 
and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent 
claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) 
alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such 
Contribution(s) was submitted.

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity 
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your 
Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or 
contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity 
under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date 
such litigation is filed.

### 4. Representations and Warranties

You represent and warrant that:

a) You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses.

b) Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation and does not violate any 
   third party's copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other intellectual property 
   rights.

c) Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license 
   or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and 
   trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any 
   part of Your Contributions.

d) If You are an employee, You have obtained permission from Your employer to make 
   the Contribution on behalf of Your employer, or Your employer has waived such 
   rights for Your Contributions to the Project.

e) If Your Contribution is based on previous work that is not Your original 
   creation, You submit it separately, identifying the complete details of its 
   source and of any license or other restriction of which You are personally aware.

### 5. Notification of Changes

You agree to notify the Project of any facts or circumstances of which you become 
aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.

### 6. Support and Warranty Disclaimer

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent 
You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not 
at all.

UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, YOU PROVIDE YOUR 
CONTRIBUTIONS ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, 
EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR 
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE.

### 7. Employer Contributions

If Your Contribution is made in the course of Your work for an employer or if Your 
employer has intellectual property rights in Your Contribution by contract or 
applicable law, You must secure permission from Your employer before signing this 
Agreement. In such cases, the term "You" in this Agreement will refer to You and 
the employer collectively.

### 8. Dual Licensing Acknowledgment

You acknowledge and agree that:

a) The Project maintains PEL under a dual licensing model: AGPL-3.0-or-later for 
   open source use and a Commercial License for proprietary use.

b) Your Contributions will be available under both licenses.

c) The Project (represented by David Travers) has the right to grant Commercial 
   Licenses for Your Contributions without seeking further permission from You and 
   without sharing revenue with You.

d) This arrangement allows the Project to sustain development while keeping the 
   software available as open source under AGPL-3.0.

### 9. Governing Law

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of 
the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

### 10. Entire Agreement

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between You and the Project 
concerning Your Contributions and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, 
whether written or oral.

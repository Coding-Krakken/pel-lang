# How to Sign the PEL Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Before we can accept your contributions to PEL, you need to sign the Contributor 
License Agreement (CLA). This is a one-time process.

## Why Do We Require a CLA?

The CLA:
- Protects you, the project, and all users of PEL
- Clarifies that you have the right to contribute your code
- Allows PEL to maintain dual licensing (AGPL-3.0 + Commercial)
- Ensures contributions can be used in both open source and commercial contexts

Read the full CLA in [CLA.md](CLA.md).

## Signing Process

We currently use a **manual signing process**. Here's how it works:

### Step 1: Read the CLA

Carefully read the [CLA.md](CLA.md) document. Make sure you understand and agree 
to all terms.

### Step 2: Check Employment Status

**If you are contributing as an individual:**
- You can sign the CLA yourself if you own the copyright to your contributions

**If you are employed and contributing work-related code:**
- Check your employment contract regarding intellectual property
- You may need your employer to sign a Corporate CLA
- Contact us at davidtraversmailbox@gmail.com for the Corporate CLA

**If you are contributing open source code you wrote as part of your job:**
- Get written permission from your employer first
- Have them email davidtraversmailbox@gmail.com confirming permission

### Step 3: Sign the CLA

Send an email to **davidtraversmailbox@gmail.com** with:

**Subject:** `PEL CLA Signature - [Your Full Name]`

**Body:**
```
I, [Your Full Legal Name], hereby agree to the terms of the PEL Contributor 
License Agreement (CLA) version 1.0, as of [Today's Date].

Full Name: [Your Full Legal Name]
GitHub Username: [Your GitHub username]
Email Address: [Your email address]
Date: [Today's Date]

I have read and understand the CLA available at:
https://github.com/[pel-repo-url]/CLA.md

[If applicable] I have obtained permission from my employer to contribute, or my 
contributions are not work-related.

I understand that:
- My contributions will be dual-licensed under AGPL-3.0 and a Commercial License
- The Project can grant Commercial Licenses without further permission from me
- I am not entitled to revenue from Commercial Licenses

Signature: [Your Full Legal Name]
```

### Step 4: Confirmation

Once we receive your CLA:
1. We'll confirm receipt within 2-3 business days
2. Your name will be added to the [AUTHORS](AUTHORS) file
3. You can start contributing!

### Step 5: Make Your Contribution

After your CLA is on file:
1. Fork the repository
2. Make your changes
3. Submit a pull request
4. Reference your CLA in the PR description: "CLA signed on [date]"

## First-Time Contributors

## Corporate CLA

If you're contributing on behalf of a company, we have a separate Corporate CLA. 
This is needed when:
- Your employment contract assigns IP rights to your employer
- You're contributing as part of your job
- Your company wants multiple employees to contribute

**To obtain a Corporate CLA:**
Email davidtraversmailbox@gmail.com with:
- Your company name and address
- Name and email of authorized signatory
- List of employees who will contribute

We'll send you the Corporate CLA document for execution.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to sign again for each contribution?**  
A: No! The CLA covers all your current and future contributions to PEL.

**Q: Can I contribute without signing the CLA?**  
A: No. We cannot accept any contributions without a signed CLA. This protects 
everyone involved.

**Q: What if I'm not sure about my employment status?**  
A: Check your employment contract or ask your manager/HR department. When in doubt, 
have your employer sign the Corporate CLA.

**Q: Is my CLA signature public?**  
A: Your name will appear in the AUTHORS file, but your signature email is kept 
private.

**Q: Does signing the CLA transfer copyright to the project?**  
A: No! You retain copyright to your contributions. The CLA only grants us licenses 
to use your contributions under both AGPL-3.0 and Commercial License.

**Q: Can I revoke my CLA?**  
A: No. The CLA grants irrevocable licenses. However, you can stop making new 
contributions at any time.

**Q: What happens to my contributions under the Commercial License?**  
A: The Project (represented by David Travers) can grant Commercial Licenses that 
allow companies to use PEL (including your contributions) in proprietary software 
without source code disclosure. You won't receive compensation from these licenses, 
but this model helps sustain the project.

**Q: I found a bug but don't want to sign a CLA. Can I report it?**  
A: Yes! Bug reports, feature requests, and discussions don't require a CLA. Only 
code contributions (patches, pull requests, etc.) need a CLA.

## Alternative: Automated CLA Bot (Future)

We're considering adding an automated CLA bot (like CLA Assistant) in the future. 
This would allow you to sign the CLA directly on GitHub when submitting your first 
pull request.

For now, please use the manual email process above.

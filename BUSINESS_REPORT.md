## Risk Assessment

### Uncertainty Factors

**High Uncertainty:**
- Client acquisition rate (50% confidence)
- Market conditions and competition
- Referral conversion rates

**Medium Uncertainty:**
- Marketing budget effectiveness (80% confidence)
- Home office cost allocation (90% confidence)

**Low Uncertainty:**
- Software costs (100% confidence - fixed subscriptions)
- Current revenue (95% confidence - contracted work)

### Sensitivity Analysis

The 10% monthly growth assumption is critical:
- **Conservative scenario (5% growth):** Would still reach ~$13,000/month by Month 12
- **Aggressive scenario (15% growth):** Could reach ~$44,000/month by Month 12
- **No growth (0%):** Revenue stays at $8,000, profit at $7,000/month

## Recommendations

1. **Track Actual vs. Projected Monthly**
   - Update model with real data each month
   - Adjust growth assumptions based on actual client acquisition

2. **Diversify Client Base**
   - Current reliance on 2 clients is risky
   - Target: 5-7 clients by Month 6 to reduce concentration risk

3. **Marketing ROI Analysis**
   - Track which $500/month marketing channels generate leads
   - Reallocate budget to highest-performing channels

4. **Build Financial Runway**
   - Use cumulative profit to build 6-month emergency fund
   - Target: $48,000 reserve by Month 6

5. **Re-evaluate Quarterly**
   - Run updated projections every 3 months
   - Adjust assumptions based on actual performance

## Methodology

- **Analysis Tool:** PEL v0.1.0 (Programmable Economic Language)
- **Model Type:** Time-series financial projection
- **Execution Mode:** Deterministic with documented assumptions
- **Time Horizon:** 12 months

- Supporting notes

This ensures the model is auditable and assumptions can be updated as real data becomes available.

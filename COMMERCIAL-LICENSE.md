# PEL Commercial License Guide

## What is Dual Licensing?

PEL (Programmable Economic Language) is available under two different licenses:

| License | Best For | Cost | Requirements |
|---------|----------|------|--------------|
| **AGPL-3.0** | Open source projects, research, internal tools | Free | Must share source code when offering as a service |
| **Commercial** | Proprietary products, SaaS offerings, closed-source apps | Paid | No source code disclosure required |

You choose which license fits your use case.

---

## Do You Need a Commercial License?

### ✅ You NEED a Commercial License if you:

- **Build proprietary software** using PEL without open-sourcing it
- **Offer PEL-based services** (SaaS, API, cloud platform) without sharing your source code
- **Embed PEL in a commercial product** that you sell or license
- **Modify PEL** and don't want to share your modifications publicly
- **Want to avoid AGPL compliance** obligations and legal complexity

### ✗ You DON'T NEED a Commercial License if you:

- **Build open source software** and release it under AGPL-3.0 or compatible license
- **Use PEL internally** only (not providing it as a service to others)
- **Research or academic use** where you're comfortable with AGPL requirements
- **Experiment or prototype** without commercial deployment

**When in doubt:** Contact us! We'll help you determine which license applies.

## What Does the AGPL-3.0 Require?

The AGPL-3.0 (Affero General Public License) is like the GPL, but with an important 
network provision:

### Key AGPL Requirements:

1. **Network Use = Distribution**: If you run PEL on a server and let users interact 
   with it over a network (e.g., web service, API, SaaS), you must provide the 
   source code to those users.

2. **Share Modifications**: Any changes you make to PEL must be released under 
   AGPL-3.0 as well.

3. **Compatible Licensing**: If you combine PEL with other software, that software 
   must be AGPL-compatible.

4. **Attribution**: You must retain copyright notices and license information.

### Example Scenarios:

| Scenario | AGPL-3.0 OK? | Need Commercial? |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| Use PEL internally for your company's financial modeling | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (internal use only) |
| Offer a SaaS platform that uses PEL for customers | ❌ No* | ✅ Yes (unless you open-source everything) |
| Build a financial app and sell it | ❌ No* | ✅ Yes (unless app is AGPL) |
| Use PEL in open source research software | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Modify PEL and keep changes private | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Bundle PEL with proprietary tools | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

*You CAN use AGPL-3.0 if you're willing to open-source your entire application under AGPL-3.0.

## Pricing

Commercial License pricing is determined based on:

### Factors:
- **Use case** (embedded product, SaaS, internal tool, etc.)

# SCALABILITY SUMMARY
# ==============================================================================

scalability_summary:
  overall_scalability: "Moderate to High with disciplined execution"
  
  scalability_strengths:
    - "Unit economics improve with scale (purchasing, overhead leverage)"
    - "Operational model standardizes and replicates"
    - "Brand strength accelerates new location ramps"
    - "Talent development pathways support growth"
    - "Franchise model provides capital-efficient late-stage growth"
  
  scalability_constraints:
    - "Fleet logistics complexity increases non-linearly beyond 25 locations per cluster"
    - "Geographic expansion requires regional cluster approach (not linear national)"
    - "Quality control and safety culture challenging at scale"
    - "Real estate availability constrains pace in many markets"
    - "Capital requirements significant for corporate-owned expansion"
    - "Management talent depth required"
  
  optimal_scaling_path:
    years_1_3: "Launch and optimize 5-location initial cluster"
    years_4_7: "Scale to 15 locations in 2-3 regional clusters"
    years_8_10: "Reach 25-30 locations, prove franchise model"
    years_11_plus: "Franchise-led expansion to 50-100+ locations"
  
  scaling_velocities:
    conservative: "2-3 new locations per year (cash flow funded)"
    moderate: "4-5 new locations per year (equity + debt funded)"
    aggressive: "7-10 new locations per year (well-capitalized, franchise hybrid)"
  
  scaling_risks:
    operational_complexity: "Managing fleet logistics and quality at scale"
    capital_constraints: "Growth rate limited by available capital"
    talent_depth: "Finding sufficient management talent"
    market_saturation: "Running out of tier 1 markets"
    competitive_response: "Imitators emerging as success becomes visible"
  
  recommended_scaling_strategy:
    "Moderate pace through corporate-owned expansion to 15-20 locations (Year 7),
    then transition to franchise-dominant model for rapid geographic expansion.
    Prioritize operational excellence and brand strength over growth velocity.
    Regional cluster approach maintains fleet model economics."
  
  terminal_scale_estimate:
    corporate_owned: "25-35 locations"
    franchise: "50-150 locations"
    total_network: "75-185 locations"

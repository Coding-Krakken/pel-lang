Pilot Plan & Measurement Protocol — FunZone (90 day pilot)

Objective
- Validate visit frequency lift, price elasticity, fleet rotation logistics, and unit-level economics at 3 pilot locations.

Scope
- 3 sites (urban/suburban mix), common offer with controlled local promotions.

Key metrics (daily / weekly)
- Visits per day (unique & repeat)
- Revenue per visit (tickets, F&B, add-ons)
- Conversion rate from promotion → visit
- Equipment downtime / rotation latency
- Maintenance cost per rotation

Data & instrumentation
- POS integration for per-visit revenue.
- Single-sign-on QR for loyalty to track unique repeat visits.
- Simple maintenance log (digital) for fleet incidents and turnaround time.

Experiment cadence
- Week 0: install systems, staff training, baseline 2 weeks measurement.
- Weeks 3–12: run rotation cadence (weekly swap for fleet elements), measure lift vs baseline.
- Weekly review: top-line visits, revenue, maintenance incidents, customer satisfaction.

Acceptance criteria
- >10% weekly repeat visit rate by week 8; unit-level EBITDA trending positive within pilot sites; rotation downtime <6%.

Deliverables after 90 days
- Cleaned dataset, pilot dashboard, updated unit economics, recommended scale plan (0–10 sites).

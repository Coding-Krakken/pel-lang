risk_assessment_summary:
  overall_risk_profile: "High risk industry requiring sophisticated management"
  
  highest_risks:
    1: "Catastrophic safety incident (low probability, existential impact)"
    2: "Liability insurance market hardening (moderate probability, severe impact)"
    3: "Fleet logistics safety failure (moderate probability, high impact)"
    4: "Economic recession demand collapse (moderate probability, severe impact)"
  
  manageable_risks:
    - "Regulatory compliance (high cost but manageable with systems)"
    - "Routine injury claims (insurable and expected)"
    - "Employment practices (HR systems mitigate)"
    - "Operational failures (contingency planning)"
  
  risk_management_imperatives:
    - "Safety culture must be genuine and pervasive - non-negotiable"
    - "Insurance program comprehensive and maintained"
    - "Cash reserves for unexpected events"

    - "Crisis management plans prepared and practiced"
  
  risk_adjusted_assessment: |
    Business model has inherent high risks (children, physical activity, liability).
    Fleet rotation adds unique risks requiring heightened protocols.
    Risk profile manageable with disciplined operations and adequate capital reserves.
    Single catastrophic failure can destroy business - safety excellence paramount.
    Insurance costs and liability exposure are structural costs of industry entry.

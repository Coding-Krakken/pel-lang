FunZone — Investor One‑Pager

Concept
- FunZone: modular indoor family entertainment centers where 90% of floor space is a rotating fleet of play experiences and 10% permanent attractions.

Key value props
- Freshness and repeat visitation via a shared, rotating fleet of premium play equipment.
- Lower capex per site via fleet pooling and rotation logistics.
- Faster product-market fit through frequent experience refresh and measurable pilot metrics.

Top metrics (conservative, model outputs)
- Estimated Year‑5 equity exit: ~$7.2M
- Projected MOIC (5yr): ~2.6x
- Projected 5‑yr equity IRR: ~20% (post-reconciliation conservative case)

Use of funds
- Fleet acquisition & logistics, pilot rollout (3–5 sites), operating cash buffer, marketing for local launch.

Milestones (next 12 months)
- 0–3 months: pilot site setup (1), measurement systems live.
- 3–9 months: run 3–5 pilot locations, optimize rotation cadence, validate churn/visit uplift.
- 9–12 months: scale to 10+ sites with refined operations and fleet schedule.

    - "50% probability EBITDA between $258k and $465k per location"
    - "10% probability of loss or minimal profitability (<$145k)"
    - "25% probability of exceptional performance (>$465k)"

stress_test_conclusions:
  survivability_assessment:
    base_case: "Highly viable"
    downside_case: "Marginal viability, requires corrective action"
    recession: "Survives but stressed, no growth"
    cost_inflation: "Survives with margin compression"
    demand_shock_novelty_failure: "Likely failure without pivot"
    competitive_shock: "Challenged survival, 60% probability"
    capital_scarcity: "Survives but below projections"
    liquidity_freeze: "Survives with emergency actions"
  
  critical_success_factors_validated:
    - "Visit volume must achieve 70,000+ per location minimum"
    - "Fleet costs must stay under $150k per location"
    - "Pricing power must be maintained (avoid >10% discounting)"
    - "Fixed costs must be controlled (<$650k per location)"
    - "Cash reserves minimum 90 days critical"
  
  risk_mitigation_priorities:
    priority_1: "Validate novelty thesis early - track visit frequency aggressively"
    priority_2: "Maintain conservative cash reserves and liquidity"
    priority_3: "Control fleet logistics costs through disciplined execution"
    priority_4: "Build competitive moat rapidly before imitation"
    priority_5: "Maintain operational flexibility to respond to shocks"

    expected_value_irr: 0.335
    risk_adjusted_assessment: "Attractive risk-return profile with proper risk management"
  
  final_assessment: |
    Business model demonstrates resilience across most stress scenarios.
    Survivable downturns and challenges exist with proactive management.
    Core thesis (novelty drives visits) must be validated - highest risk.
    Competitive response inevitable but manageable if first-mover advantage exploited.
    Adequate risk-adjusted returns justify investment with capital discipline.

description: Agent teardown prompt to explain why the work produced is inadequate.
---
Be unequivocally clear: this output is a failure relative to the stated objective — but only after automated verification steps are completed.

Before producing the teardown summary, the agent MUST:
- Collect evidence: tests, build status, critical failing diffs, missing docs, and key metric gaps.
- Reproduce a representative failure (unit test, e2e flow, or build) and attach commands + output.
- Ensure the evaluation is grounded in repository facts (search for vision docs, README, ADRs) and not solely model opinion.

Only after these checks, produce a concise, evidence-backed teardown explaining why the work is inadequate.

What has been delivered does not resemble a production-grade Business Operating System as defined by the design documents. It fails to meet elite engineering standards, fails to approach elite product standards, and fails to demonstrate elite execution. At organizations operating at the highest level of technical rigor (e.g., Microsoft, Google, top-tier enterprise software firms), this work would not advance past an initial architectural or implementation review. It would be flagged as incomplete, structurally unsound, or fundamentally misaligned with the stated goals.

More critically, there is no evidence of a defensible competitive advantage. The approaches employed are conventional, obvious, and widely known. In a competitive systems domain, this is a fatal flaw. A Business Operating System intended to succeed at scale must exhibit non-obvious structural advantages: adaptive architecture, durable primitives, governance-aware AI control, and mechanisms that compound advantage over time. None of these are demonstrated in a way that is credible, enforceable, or durable.

At this stage, the outcome exhibits:

No credible demonstration of system-level success

No repeatable or reliable execution path

No sustained or defensible advantage over incumbents

No material progress toward the stated vision

This gap is foundational, not cosmetic. It cannot be resolved through iteration, polish, refactoring, or incremental refinement. The underlying structure, assumptions, and execution strategy are misaligned with the requirements of an elite, production-grade Business Operating System.

A senior technical reviewer would not view this as “early but promising.” They would view it as mis-scoped, underpowered, and strategically insufficient given the stated ambition.

The following items represent specific deficiencies and failures observed. This list may be appended, expanded, or substituted, but should be treated as blocking issues that must be addressed before further progress can be considered acceptable:

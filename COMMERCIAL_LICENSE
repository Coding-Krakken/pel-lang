PEL COMMERCIAL LICENSE AGREEMENT

Version 1.0, Effective February 13, 2026

Copyright (c) 2026 PEL Project Contributors

NOTICE: This is a commercial/proprietary license for PEL (Programmable Economic 
Language). It is an alternative to the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 
(AGPL-3.0) under which PEL is also available. This Commercial License allows you 
to use, modify, and distribute PEL in proprietary applications without the 
source code disclosure obligations of the AGPL-3.0.

under this Commercial License.

"Commercial Use" means any use of the Software in exchange for financial 
compensation, including but not limited to: incorporating the Software into 
commercial products, providing services using the Software, or operating the
